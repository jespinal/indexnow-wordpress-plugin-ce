## Attribution
This plugin is a community-maintained fork of the original IndexNow plugin by Microsoft Bing. The original plugin is no longer maintained, so this fork provides modern WordPress compatibility while maintaining the same core functionality.

We thank Microsoft Bing for creating the original IndexNow plugin and making it available under the GPL-2.0+ license, which allows for community maintenance and improvement.

## Disclaimer
**Important**: This is a personal fork maintained by jespinal. I am not an expert in IndexNow technology - I'm just trying to make it work with modern WordPress. Use this plugin at your own risk and responsibility.
