# Contributing to IndexNow Community Edition

## 🤝 Project Status

This is a **personal fork** of the original Microsoft IndexNow plugin, maintained by [@jespinal](https://github.com/jespinal). While I appreciate community interest, unfortunatelly I have limited time availability for managing contributions.

## 🎯 What This Means

- **This is a personal project** shared publicly for others' benefit
- **I maintain this for my own use** and WordPress sites
- **Community Edition** refers to it being a personal fork from (and for) the community
- **Limited time availability** means I can't commit to regular contribution management

## 🐛 Bug Reports & Suggestions

**If you find bugs or have suggestions:**

1. **Open an issue** for discussion - I may or may not address it
2. **Fork the project** for your own modifications
3. **Consider creating your own fork** if you need different features
4. **Use it as-is** if it meets your needs

## ⏰ Time Constraints

Due to limited time availability, I'm not able to:
- ⏰ Review pull requests for new features
- ⏰ Review pull requests for bug fixes (unless critical)
- ⏰ Take on co-maintainers or regular contributors
- ⏰ Provide immediate responses to issues
- ⏰ Implement feature requests that don't align with my use case

## ✅ What I AM Open To

- ✅ **Bug reports** - I'll consider fixing critical issues
- ✅ **Documentation improvements** - If you find unclear instructions
- ✅ **Security issues** - Please report these privately
- ✅ **Forking for your own needs** - This is encouraged!
